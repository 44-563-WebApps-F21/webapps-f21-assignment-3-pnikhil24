    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">In computer programming, a string is
        traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may
        allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is
        generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that
        stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. String may also denote more
        general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structure</blockquote>
