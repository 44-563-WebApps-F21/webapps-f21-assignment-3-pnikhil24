    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree"> A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree is a data
        structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers.
        This structure was proposed by Boris Ryabko in 1989[1] with a further modification published in 1992.[2] It has
        subsequently become known under the name Fenwick tree after Peter Fenwick, who described this structure in his
        1994 article. When compared with a flat array of numbers, the Fenwick tree achieves a much better balance
        between operations: element update and prefix sum calculation. A flat array of {\displaystyle n}n numbers can
        either store the elements or the prefix sums. In the first case, computing prefix sums requires linear time; in
        the
        second case, updating the array elements requires linear time (in both cases, the other operation can be
        performed in constant time). Fenwick trees allow both operations to be performed in {\displaystyle O(\log
        n)}O(\log n) time. This is achieved by representing the numbers as a tree, where the value of each node is the
        sum of the numbers in that subtree. Link to the Code Source</blockquote>
